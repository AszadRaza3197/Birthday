Make sure all files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, and audio) are in the same directory.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

✅ No installation or server needed — it's a pure frontend project!

💡 Notes
Works best in modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

Ensure your browser supports HTML5 audio for full experience.

All media (MP3, images) should be placed in the same folder as index.html or properly linked.

The .less file is compiled via CDN using LESS.js — no local preprocessor setup required.
